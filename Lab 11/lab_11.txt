What is the big O runtime of insert on a set? A map?

    For a set, insertion takes O(log(n)), where N is the size of the set.
    For a map, insertion takes O(log(n)) when only element is being inserted, and O(1) when position is also given.

What is the difference between a set and a map?

    A set contains only store keys. In a set, the values are irrelevant.
    A map contains the data as a key-value pair, so key and value. Also, it stores keys sorted and maps keys to values.
    To access a value in a set, you use iterators, while to access a value in a map, you use the key to retrieve the associated value. Memory is another big difference,
    maps typically require more memory than sets because they store key-value pairs rather than just single values.

Why are sets and maps useful?

    Sets are used to get information of an object by providing all the information, usually used to check if the data exists. 
    A map is used to get the information of an object by using a key (single data).
    They enforce uniqueness among elements, a set each element only appears once, a map each key must be unique,
    this can be useful in scenarios where data consistency and correctness are critical, such as in databases or when processing user input.
    And maps establish relationship between pieces of data, which contributes to fast look up operations, which is useful for different applications, in which data needs to be accessed efficiently.
